# Agenda for call meetings 
_(we can feel this cooperatively)_

## 15th Oct

1) Updates on our work, present and future challenges
2) Plots to include in the publication
3) Models to include in the publication
4) Parallelisation
5) Estimated submission time
6) Models divergencies and tree depth limits, identifying the problems
7) What comparison algorithms should we use
8) How do I use sharepoint properly? I am only able to download a few files at a time... (probably just missing something basic)
9) SBC & checking the models work as intended
10) sum to 0 constrain for logNormal_multinomial. Just on lambda or on lambda and theta[n]?
